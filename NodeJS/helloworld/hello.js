/*   Run the JavaScript file by typing node hello.js.
 Note: Running this file in Node.js does not support browser-based objects like window since Node.js only includes server-side functionality.
 Node.js is optimized for server use and excludes browser-specific JavaScript features, such as window, navigator, and document.
   JavaScript functions specific to the browser won't work here; Node.js focuses on core JavaScript, file handling, cryptography, etc. */
